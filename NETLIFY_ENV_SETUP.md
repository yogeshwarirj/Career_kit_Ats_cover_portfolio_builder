## Method 3: netlify.toml File (Advanced)

### Create netlify.toml in your project root:
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  # Note: Don't put sensitive keys here as they'll be in your repository
  # Use this only for non-sensitive configuration

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[context.production.environment]
  # Production-specific environment variables
  # Still use Netlify dashboard for sensitive keys

[context.deploy-preview.environment]
  # Deploy preview environment variables
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Use Netlify dashboard for sensitive keys
- Prefix client-side variables with `VITE_`
- Keep API keys secure and never commit them to git
- Use different keys for development and production

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Put sensitive keys in netlify.toml (it's in your repo)
- Share API keys publicly
- Use production keys in development
- Commit .env files to version control

---

## üö® Important Notes

### For Vite Applications:
- **All environment variables must be prefixed with `VITE_`**
- Example: `VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` not `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
- This is a Vite security feature

### After Adding Variables:
1. **Always redeploy** your site after adding environment variables
2. **Check the build logs** to ensure variables are being loaded
3. **Test the features** that depend on these variables

### Troubleshooting:
- If variables aren't working, check the prefix (`VITE_`)
- Ensure you've redeployed after adding variables
- Check browser console for any API key errors
- Verify API keys are valid and have proper permissions
