# 🎤 Voice Playback Behavior Guide

## New Improved Behavior

### AI Speech Completion
✅ **The AI now waits to finish speaking before advancing to the next message/feature**
✅ **No more cutting off mid-sentence - the AI completes every word**
✅ **Proper timing based on actual speech duration, not fixed timers**

## How It Works

### Hero AI Character
- **Sequential Playback**: Messages play one after another
- **Speech Completion**: Each message is fully spoken before moving to the next
- **Loop Behavior**: After the last message, it starts over from the beginning
- **Pause/Resume**: You can pause at any time and resume from where you left off

### Tavus AI Career Coach (Explainer)
- **Feature-by-Feature**: Explains each CareerKit feature completely
- **Speech Completion**: Waits for full explanation before allowing navigation
- **Manual Navigation**: Use arrow buttons to jump between features
- **Auto-Advance**: When playing, automatically moves to next feature after speech completes

## User Experience Improvements

### Clear Status Indicators
- 🟢 **"AI Assistant Speaking"** - Currently speaking, please wait
- 🔵 **"AI Assistant Active"** - Playing but between messages
- ⚪ **"Click Play to Start"** - Ready to begin
- 🟡 **"Add API key for voice"** - Voice setup needed

### Toast Notifications
- 🎤 **"AI Career Coach is now speaking!"** - When starting presentation
- ⏸️ **"AI presentation paused"** - When paused
- 🎉 **"AI Career Coach presentation complete!"** - When finished
- 🔧 **"Voice setup needed!"** - When API key missing

### Smart Fallbacks
- **No Voice Setup**: Still shows text with appropriate timing
- **Network Issues**: Gracefully handles connection problems
- **API Limits**: Clear messages about quota usage
